# Lines of Code
One way to measure the complexity of a program is to count its number of lines of code (LOC), excluding blank lines and comments. For instance, a 
program like
```python

# Say hello

name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"hello, {name}")
```

has just two lines of code, not four, since its first line is a comment, and its second line is blank (i.e., just whitespace). That’s not that many, so 
odds are the program isn’t that complex. Of course, just because a program (or even function) has more lines of code than another doesn’t necessarily 
mean it’s more complex. For instance, a function like

```python

def is_even(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
isn’t really twice as complex as a function like

def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

even though the former has (more than) twice as many lines of code. In fact, the former might arguably be simpler if it’s easier to read! So lines of
 code should be taken with a grain of salt.
Even so, in a file called lines.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a Python file, and 
outputs the number of lines of code in that file, excluding comments and blank lines. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument,
 or if the specified file’s name does not end in .py, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.
Assume that any line that starts with #, optionally preceded by whitespace, is a comment. (A docstring should not be considered a comment.) Assume that
 any line that only contains whitespace is blank.



# Pizza Py
Perhaps the most popular place for pizza in Harvard Square is Pinocchio’s Pizza & Subs, aka Noch’s, known for its Sicilian pizza, which is “a deep-dish
 or thick-crust pizza.”
Students tend to buy pizza by the slice, but Pinocchio’s also has whole pizzas on its menu too, per this CSV file of Sicilian pizzas, sicilian.csv, 
below:

```python

Sicilian Pizza,Small,Large
Cheese,$25.50,$39.95
1 item,$27.50,$41.95
2 items,$29.50,$43.95
3 items,$31.50,$45.95
Special,$33.50,$47.95

```
See regular.csv for a CSV file of regular pizzas as well.

Of course, a CSV file isn’t the most customer-friendly format to look at. Prettier might be a table, formatted as ASCII art, like this one:
```python

+------------------+---------+---------+
| Sicilian Pizza   | Small   | Large   |
+==================+=========+=========+
| Cheese           | $25.50  | $39.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+
| 1 item           | $27.50  | $41.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+
| 2 items          | $29.50  | $43.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+
| 3 items          | $31.50  | $45.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+
| Special          | $33.50  | $47.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+

```

In a file called pizza.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a CSV file in Pinocchio’s format,
 and outputs a table formatted as ASCII art using tabulate, a package on PyPI at pypi.org/project/tabulate. Format the table using the library’s grid
  format. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified file’s name does not end in .csv, or if the specified 
  file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.


# Scourgify
“Ah, well,” said Tonks, slamming the trunk’s lid shut, “at least it’s all in. That could do with a bit of cleaning, too.” She pointed her wand at 
Hedwig’s cage. “Scourgify.” A few feathers and droppings vanished.
— Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix
Data, too, often needs to be “cleaned,” as by reformatting it, so that values are in a consistent, if not more convenient, format. Consider, for 
instance, this CSV file of students, before.csv, below:

```python

name,house
"Abbott, Hannah",Hufflepuff
"Bell, Katie",Gryffindor
"Bones, Susan",Hufflepuff
"Boot, Terry",Ravenclaw
"Brown, Lavender",Gryffindor
"Bulstrode, Millicent",Slytherin
"Chang, Cho",Ravenclaw
"Clearwater, Penelope",Ravenclaw
"Crabbe, Vincent",Slytherin
"Creevey, Colin",Gryffindor
"Creevey, Dennis",Gryffindor
"Diggory, Cedric",Hufflepuff
"Edgecombe, Marietta",Ravenclaw
"Finch-Fletchley, Justin",Hufflepuff
"Finnigan, Seamus",Gryffindor
"Goldstein, Anthony",Ravenclaw
"Goyle, Gregory",Slytherin
"Granger, Hermione",Gryffindor
"Johnson, Angelina",Gryffindor
"Jordan, Lee",Gryffindor
"Longbottom, Neville",Gryffindor
"Lovegood, Luna",Ravenclaw
"Lupin, Remus",Gryffindor
"Malfoy, Draco",Slytherin
"Malfoy, Scorpius",Slytherin
"Macmillan, Ernie",Hufflepuff
"McGonagall, Minerva",Gryffindor
"Midgen, Eloise",Gryffindor
"McLaggen, Cormac",Gryffindor
"Montague, Graham",Slytherin
"Nott, Theodore",Slytherin
"Parkinson, Pansy",Slytherin
"Patil, Padma",Gryffindor
"Patil, Parvati",Gryffindor
"Potter, Harry",Gryffindor
"Riddle, Tom",Slytherin
"Robins, Demelza",Gryffindor
"Scamander, Newt",Hufflepuff
"Slughorn, Horace",Slytherin
"Smith, Zacharias",Hufflepuff
"Snape, Severus",Slytherin
"Spinnet, Alicia",Gryffindor
"Sprout, Pomona",Hufflepuff
"Thomas, Dean",Gryffindor
"Vane, Romilda",Gryffindor
"Warren, Myrtle",Ravenclaw
"Weasley, Fred",Gryffindor
"Weasley, George",Gryffindor
"Weasley, Ginny",Gryffindor
"Weasley, Percy",Gryffindor
"Weasley, Ron",Gryffindor
"Wood, Oliver",Gryffindor
"Zabini, Blaise",Slytherin
```
Even though each “row” in the file has three values (last name, first name, and house), the first two are combined into one “column” (name), escaped 
with double quotes, with last name and first name separated by a comma and space. Not ideal if Hogwarts wants to send a form letter to each student, as
 via mail merge, since it’d be strange to start a letter with:


Dear Potter, Harry,

Rather than with, for instance:

Dear Harry,

In a file called scourgify.py, implement a program that:

Expects the user to provide two command-line arguments:
the name of an existing CSV file to read as input, whose columns are assumed to be, in order, name and house, and
the name of a new CSV to write as output, whose columns should be, in order, first, last, and house.
Converts that input to that output, splitting each name into a first name and last name. Assume that each student will have both a first name and last name.
If the user does not provide exactly two command-line arguments, or if the first cannot be read, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.



# CS50 P-Shirt
After finishing CS50 itself, students on campus at Harvard traditionally receive their very own I took CS50 t-shirt. No need to buy one online, but like to try one on virtually?

In a file called shirt.py, implement a program that expects exactly two command-line arguments:

in sys.argv[1], the name (or path) of a JPEG or PNG to read (i.e., open) as input
in sys.argv[2], the name (or path) of a JPEG or PNG to write (i.e., save) as output
The program should then overlay shirt.png (which has a transparent background) on the input after resizing and cropping the input to be the same size, saving the result as its output.

Open the input with Image.open, per pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.open, resize and crop the input with ImageOps.fit, per pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageOps.html#PIL.ImageOps.fit, using default values for method, bleed, and centering, overlay the shirt with Image.paste, per pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.paste, and save the result with Image.save, per pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html#PIL.Image.Image.save.

The program should instead exit via sys.exit:

if the user does not specify exactly two command-line arguments,
if the input’s and output’s names do not end in .jpg, .jpeg, or .png, case-insensitively,
if the input’s name does not have the same extension as the output’s name, or
if the specified input does not exist.
Assume that the input will be a photo of someone posing in just the right way, like these demos, so that, when they’re resized and cropped, the shirt appears to fit perfectly.

If you’d like to run your program on a photo of yourself, first drag the photo over to VS Code’s file explorer, into the same folder as shirt.py. No need to submit any photos with your code. But, if you would like, you’re welcome (but not expected) to share a photo of yourself wearing your virtual shirt in any of CS50’s communities!
